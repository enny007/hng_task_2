App Description
 * This is a simple Portfolio app that showcases my social network links and a brief introduction to my flutter experience. The app can adapt to the theme of the device on which it is being run on and also adapt to both portrait and landscape orientations.
==============================================================
 Codebase Description
 * This app is divided into three main folders i.e. the componnets folder where the resusable custom widgets and menu package are placed, the helper folder where the themeprovider class is placed and the page folder where all the app pages are placed.
==============================================================
 App Design
 * The overall app design is very simple and minimalistic. A splashpage is first displayed before the homepage is being displayed, a drawer widget controls the navigation of the whole app.
 =============================================================
 Library Description
 * I used the provider package and the shared preference package for theming and theming storage respectively. I used the hidden_menu drawer package to create a beautiful drawer with animated sliders. I used the Google Fonts package for custom fonts. I used the font awesome icon package to get the social media icons. Lastly, i used the url_launcher for access to the embedded social media links.
 =============================================================
 Extra Feature If there was time
 * I could not figure out the localization so i did not do it. if i had more time i would have done more research and probably found a way to implement it.

 Challenges Faced
 * I did not face any challenge that pertained to coding. my challenges during this task were more infrastructural based i.e. epilleptic power supply.
